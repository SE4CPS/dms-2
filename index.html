         <h2>Research and Teaching Interests</h2>
        <p>Dr. Berhe has been developing software since 2001 and completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Software Engineering in 2011 from the University of Connecticut. His industry responsibility afterward includes developing, coordinating, and leading Industry 4.0 software systems in various domains such as health care, automotive, retail, and e-mobility.</p>

        <h3>Teaching</h3>
        <p>Dr. Berhe’s teaching interests include software engineering, database systems, and mobile application development. He is passionate about preparing students with the necessary skills to excel in the rapidly evolving field of technology. His courses are designed to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical experience.</p>
        <p>For more information on the Database Management Systems II course, please visit the course page:</p>
